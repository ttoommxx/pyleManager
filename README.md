# pyleManager

Very simple file picker (path) written in python. The part of the script that handles keyboard input was written by AI (thank you ChatGPT).

## requirements

Run the script through python. After selecting a file, a new file containing the path will be created, named "file_picked".

## compatibility

Works on Linux (Wayland and X11), should work on Windows but haven't tested (please let me know if it does).

## to do

- add option to open files, for example via xdg-open (see windows for similar), nano etc, or save the path locally
