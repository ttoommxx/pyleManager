# pyleManager 0.6

Very simple file manager written in python. The part of the script that handles keyboard input was written by AI (thank you chatGPT).

## usage

Run the script through python, version >= 3.10. For example, on mainstream Linux distros, run in terminal
```
python3 pyleManager.py
```
supports arguments `-manager` (file manager) and `-picker` (file picker, prints path)

## compatibility

Works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. It should also work on any system that supports python, with the exception of opening files and terminal file editor.

## to do

- suggestions?
