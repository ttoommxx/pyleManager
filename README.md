# pyleManager 0.6

Very simple file manager written in python. The part of the script that handles keyboard input was written by AI (thank you chatGPT).

## usage

Run the script through python, version >= 3.10. For example, on mainstream Linux distros, run in terminal
```
python3 pyleManager.py
```
supports arguments `-manager` (file manager) and `-picker` (file picker, prints path)

## compatibility

Works on Linux (Wayland and X11), should work on Windows but haven't tested (please let me know if it does).

## to do

- suggestions?
- add colors
- time created
