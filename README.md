# pyleManager 0.8.1

A very simple file manager written in python. The part of the script that handles keyboard input (the function getch) was written by chatGPT.

## usage

Run the script through python, version >= 3.10. For example, on mainstream Linux distros, run in terminal
```
python3 pyleManager.py
```
supports argument `-p` which returns path upon selection

## compatibility

Works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. It should also work on any system that supports python, with the exception of opening files and terminal file editor.

## to do

- suggestions?
