# pyleManager

Very simple file manager written in python. The part of the script that handles keyboard input was written by AI (thank you ChatGPT).

## requirements

Run the script through python. Opening a file prints the path to it on the terminal.

## compatibility

Works on Linux (Wayland and X11), should work on Windows but haven't tested (please let me know if it does).

## to do

- add option to open files, for example via xdg-open (see windows for similar), nano etc, or save the path locally
- add last modified and created
- permanent settings by adding configuration file
