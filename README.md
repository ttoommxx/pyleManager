# pyleManager 0.3

Very simple file manager written in python. The part of the script that handles keyboard input was written by AI (thank you chatGPT).

## requirements

Run the script through python, version >= 3.10, via
```
python3 pyleManager.py
```

## compatibility

Works on Linux (Wayland and X11), should work on Windows but haven't tested (please let me know if it does).

## to do

- add last modified and created + order by modified
